## üîÑ Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL Pipeline

### Overview:
This project involves building an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** for a crowdfunding platform. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PostgreSQL**, I extracted data from provided spreadsheets, cleaned and transformed it into structured DataFrames, and loaded the data into a PostgreSQL database.

### Key Components:
- **ETL Process**: Extracted data from **crowdfunding.xlsx** and **contacts.xlsx**, transformed it, and loaded into CSVs and PostgreSQL.
- **Database Design**: Created an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and designed a **PostgreSQL schema** for the crowdfunding database.
- **Data Export**: Exported structured data into **CSV files** for further analysis.

### Data Files:
- crowdfunding.xlsx (Crowdfunding campaign data)
- contacts.xlsx (Contact information for campaigns)
- **CSV Files**:
  - category.csv
  - subcategory.csv
  - campaign.csv
  - contacts.csv
- **SQL Schema**: crowdfunding_db_schema.sql

![ERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608fe7ce-b260-4ca0-90c7-6e705dbbe412)
### **ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram**

The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** above represents the relationships between key entities in the crowdfunding database. It provides a visual overview of how data is structured and connected across various tables, including **campaigns**, **categories**, **subcategories**, and **contacts**.

#### **Key Tables:**
- **Campaign Table**: Stores details about each crowdfunding campaign, including its **goal**, **amount pledged**, and **dates**.
- **Category & Subcategory Tables**: Define the categorization of campaigns (e.g., **Film & Video**, **Technology**) and further classify them into **subcategories** (e.g., **Animation**, **Mobile Games**).
- **Contacts Table**: Stores **contact information** associated with campaigns, helping to link users with their respective campaigns.


#### **Relationships:**
- The **Campaign Table** is linked to both the **Category** and **Subcategory** tables via **foreign keys**.
- The **Contacts Table** connects to the **Campaign Table**, linking each user to a specific campaign they‚Äôre associated with.

This ERD helps to understand the **data model** and how the different entities are related, forming the foundation for the **ETL process** and subsequent database operations.

### üåç **Flu Activity Choropleth Map**

The **flu activity choropleth map** above provides an interactive view of the **flu activity** across the United States at the **state level**. The color intensity of each state corresponds to the **flu activity level**, with darker shades indicating **higher flu activity**.

üîç **Key Features:**
- The color intensity indicates the **severity of flu activity**, with **darker shades** representing **higher activity**.
- **Hover over each state** to see specific data points, such as flu activity levels, number of cases, and hospitalization rates.
- **Explore trends over time** by selecting different time periods to see changes in flu activity.

üìä **Insights:**
- Identify regions with **high flu transmission** to support **targeted public health responses**.
- Track flu trends to predict future outbreaks and inform **vaccination and healthcare efforts**.

---

### üìö **Data Source**
The data is sourced from the **CDC FluView Interactive**, offering a comprehensive view of **influenza trends**. This data can assist:
- **Public health officials** in tracking flu spread and making timely decisions.
- **Researchers** studying flu patterns and effectiveness of interventions.
- The **general public** in understanding flu transmission and prevention.
